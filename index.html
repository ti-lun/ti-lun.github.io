            Hi! This is my little hub for my work in various areas. I've vamped, revamped, repurposed, renamed, etc. etc. this site throughout my professional career(s). I ultimately felt like tryna keep it as minimal as possible was the way to go.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted a space that belongs to me (as much as it can existing in a public space) where I can share my experiences and insight without the social priors that come along with a platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hope you enjoy perusing my site!
