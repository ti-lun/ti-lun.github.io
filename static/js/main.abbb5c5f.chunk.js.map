It's a pandemic!  Things are crazy, NOTHING makes sense, our leaders fail us over and over again and we're all just trying to not go homeless.  It's okay to feel like you're panicking and losing control.  It's okay that you're not at your best right now or that you don't know what to do.  If there's anything to take away from this faq, it's that you're awesome and worthy of being in this industry... stay strong!  Take care of yourself first, and remember that ultimately the tech industry has a shortage of software engineers.  You just need to keep the fuck going.</p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>How did you join Pathrise as a fellow and why?</h3>\n        In Winter 2018, I was contacted by Kevin (the founder) who somehow found me and said that they'd love for me to be one of the first batches of fellows to be coached.  I think I was the second ever batch of fellows.  At the time, I was <i>extremely</i> busy--I was in my last year of college with being a Microsoft student ambassador, running my own startup that had 11 people in it, going to club events, traveling, and not to mention trying to graduate with a 3.6 GPA!!!  So I really needed that extra push that Derrick, my primary mentor, constantly gave me.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>What are you up to now?</h3>\n        <p>I'm currently on a hiatus to take care of my mental and physical health.  Since the pandemic struck, I figured that I should spend this time to really take care of myself and hone in on exactly what my motives in being in tech are.  It's been fantastic and it's making me think I should take a sabbatical of some sort every once in a while!  <strong>I also mentor part-time at Pathrise, SO DO take that into consideration.</strong></p>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>Was Pathrise worth it to you?</h3>\n        <p>I would say in my case, where the first-year income percentage was much lower than it is today, yes, it was worth it.  I'm pretty damn sure I wouldn't have landed my job at Affirm for my first job without Pathrise because of their networking techniques.  I think the TC difference had I not joined Pathrise would probably be at least $30K for me.</p>\n        <p>However, I didn't stay at Affirm for a full year.  Afterwards I ended up taking a job that had a lower TC, and Pathrise readjusted the monthly payments so that it was proportional to my new salary.  I would say I would've been able to get that job by myself, without Pathrise.  So I was in a situation where, for most of the year, I was paying monthly payments for something I could have done myself.</p>\n        <p>BUT!  That initial experience of getting Affirm on my resume has been really beneficial.  I'm sure recruiters are much more impressed by my time at Affirm, the series F unicorn of FinTech, than at some startup called Binti.  I literally had Google try to poach me while I was like one month into being at Affirm!</p>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>Should I join Pathrise?</h3>\n        <p>This is definitely something that I, an internet stranger, can't really <i>tell</i> you... Naturally, you're in a position where you're naive, and Pathrise is the one who's knowledgable about your value.</p>\n        <p>But here are some questions and thoughts to help you figure it out.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><u>Figure out what EXACTLY it is you need before you start the trial, and be sure you vet for it.</u>  I would say you need to have discipline, emotional support, and behavioral skills in order to interview well.  Have you got an interview buddy?  Have you tried r/cscareerquestions on Reddit?  Have you reached out to your old classmates, even if it's nerve-wracking?  Have you tried the Pomodoro method for discipline?  Have you tried reading productivity blogs and books?</li>\n          <li><u>How bad is your financial situation?</u>  If you NEED to have money RIGHT now, I would say to just go for Pathrise because it will probably help you out in the short-term if only to have a team of people whipping at you to get better.  Once you DO have a job, then you don't have to worry financially, even if you end up paying monthly payments.</li>\n          <li><u>Imagine starting Pathrise around Christmas time.  Now imagine getting a bill of $500-700 every month until the next Christmas holiday.</u>  It doesn't feel good, eh?  Well, think about if that pain is worth whatever benefits you will be getting.</li>\n          <li><u>Is what you're doing right now working?</u>  Like all things in software engineering, you have to figure out if your current approach is giving you leads or if you're blocked.  Write down a list of things that you have tried and are trying.  Don't be stubborn--be honest with yourself, or you're going to waste time.</li>\n          <li><u>How good are you trying to get and how fast?</u>  If you are banging out Leetcode Medium 30% questions like it's nothing, you really do not need Pathrise.  Otherwise, try to ask yourself: what company are you trying to get into and for when?  If you're trying to get into Google, you need to be at a level where you're doing Medium 30% with maybe 70-80% consistency.  If you're NOT at that level, do you think that you can get there by yourself?  If you're doing Medium 70% questions ok, then you'll probably get there within a month or two of diligent practice.  But if you're trying to prep for a Google interview in two weeks and really trying to land it while being at Medium 70%, then Pathrise might be able to bump up your performance so that your chances go from, say 50% chance of landing it to 65-70%.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>Can you be my mentor?</h3>\n        <p>It depends.  Message me and I'll see what I can do.  For the most part, I can help if you're just breaking into the industry.</p>\n      </p>\n      \n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
